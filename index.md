Make in India, a type of Swadeshi movement covering 25 sectors of economy,] was launched by the Government of India on 25 September 2014 to encourage companies to manufacture their products in India. As per the current policy, 100% FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) permitted in all the 25 sectors, except for space (74%), defence (49%) and news media (26%). Japan and India announced a US$12 billion "Japan-India Make-in-India Special Finance Facility" fund. </p>

<p>Effects</p>
<p>To start a movement, you need a strategy that inspires, empowers and enables in equal measure. Make in India needed a different kind of campaign: instead of the typical statistics-laden newspaper advertisements, this exercise required messaging that was informative, well-packaged and most importantly, credible. It had to <br>(a) inspire confidence in India’s capabilities amongst potential partners abroad, the Indian business community and citizens at large; <br>(b) provide a framework for a vast amount of technical information on 25 industry sectors; and <br>(c) reach out to a vast local and global audience via social media and constantly keep them updated about opportunities, reforms, etc.
